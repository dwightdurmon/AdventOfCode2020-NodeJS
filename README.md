# 2020 Advent of Code.... Code

This repo contains my 2020 Advent of Code results.  The code is probably very ugly, but it works to get th answers.

This code is written in NodeJS.

See https://adventofcode.com/2020 for challenges.

Disclaimer:  Google was liberally used to look up code docs and samples.  Some code was shamelessly copied and modified to meet my purpose (isn't most code??)...  Also... this code is messy... very very messy.  Be warned and avert your eyes... :-)

Happy Holidays.
